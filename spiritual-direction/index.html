      Hi. I’m Aaron.
      <br><br>
      I am a poet, a theologian, and a spiritual director. I’ve been deconstructing and reconstructing my faith for over twenty years, and I believe that faith is a process, not a set of certainties.
      <br><br>
      When approaching spiritual direction, I don’t believe I have all the answers to offer, but rather I offer a presence and the ability to hold space for what you are going through as the Spirit does her work in your life. I offer another ear to help hear what God is saying to you, what you are saying to God, and what you are saying to yourself.
      <br><br>
      Hearing the divine through a trauma informed lens allows you to trust yourself, find healing for spiritual wounds, and open space in yourself to trust what you and God are doing.
      <br><br>
      I am fully queer inclusive, love working with people who are deconstructing their faith, and I believe that no matter what your relationship with church is, you have a place at God’s table.
      <br><br>
      If you are interested in spiritual direction, have questions, or would like to set up a consultation, email me and I’ll be in touch.

    <h3>Jesus is God’s nature.</h3>
    <p>As the source of all being, God is beyond our understanding. Yet, the incarnate Jesus reveals to us the fullness of God’s nature. Jesus is not an exception to God’s nature; God is Jesus.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="item">
    <h3>Humans are the image of God.</h3>
    <p>God created humanity as an original blessing; we are made in the image of God. That image remains in each and every one of us and shows us our basic identity: beloved by God.</p>
  </div>


   
      <div class="item">
        <h3>The way forward is down.</h3>
        <p>The world is a mess of power structures, systems of oppression, and struggles to be the greatest. Jesus showed us the kingdom way was always downward. His self-emptying and self donation give us the model for the way of love.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h3>No one gets out alive, but death never has the last word.</h3>
        <p>Death comes for all of us. Despite its inescapable nature, it is not the end. Jesus is the resurrection, and that tells us that the end of the story is just the beginning.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h3>We belong to each other; that’s how we get out of this.</h3>
        <p>No one exists in a vacuum. We are interconnected and that connection calls us to care for each other and discover we are loved by God and by each other.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h3>The table belongs to us all.</h3>
        <p>No one is excluded from God’s table. Not only is there a place for you, there is space for you. We are all, each of us, welcome and wanted. The bread and wine are for everyone and anyone who will come.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h3>Scripture is human with divine breath.</h3>
        <p>The Bible was written by humans recording their history, hopes, dreams, and desires as God revealed Godself to them. The Spirit of God has preserved those words, passed them down to us, and uses them to reveal Jesus to us.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h3>The world is sacramental.</h3>
        <p>The best way we find the grace and presence of God is in the good, physical world around us. Our experience of the world and people around us shows us that God is present, that Jesus is real, and that the Spirit is alive and well, working all around us.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h3>Everyone lives.</h3>
        <p>Salvation comes for us all. Jesus keeps us in his hands, and through his life, death, resurrection, and promise to return, we will all find liberation.</p>
