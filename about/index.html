    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="lede">
      Aaron J. Smith is a dad, husband, nerd, coffee chugger and kind of a mess. He hates writing about himself. It is the worst.

Aaron tries to live out a self-donating, other-centered love as a post-Christian follower of the Jesus way, a theologian, a spiritual director, and a writer. He writes at The Book of Common Words, where he attempts to explore a post-Christian spirituality of being human.

Aaron grew up in Utah and moved to the Pacific Northwest in his late 20s, where he now lives with his wife and two kids.
